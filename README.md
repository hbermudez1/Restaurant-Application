# Senior Capstone: Restaurant-Application


# Problem:
As the number of mobile applications increase over the years, people will set higher expectations for how it should react and respond. It is no different for a restaurant app. After researching and testing out various applications, some key features that was shown  were: technical glitches, poor user interface, and outdated restaurant information. Addressing these issues requires ongoing monitoring, proactive communication with users and stakeholders, regular updates and improvements, and a commitment to delivering a seamless and satisfying experience for users.  

# Technologies Used:
Languages and Frameworks
React Native
NodeJS
Javascript


Software:
Visual Studio Code
MongoDB
Ngrok
Xcode (Simulator)
Expo

# High-Level Functional Requirements
Users can create an account and log into the app
Users can search for any restaurants based on food type
Results show low, mid and high prices.
Results show number of stars, reviews, and can be taken to the main restaurant page. 
Users can sign out, and log in from another account if desired.  

# High-Level Non-Functional Requirements
Response Time: The app should have a maximum response time of 2 seconds for any user interaction.
Scalability: The system should be able to handle a 20% increase in concurrent users without degradation in performance.

# Best Practices used for this application
Project Setup: Utilized the package manager  npm for managing dependencies, as well as kept the project dependencies up-to-date to leverage the latest features and security fixes.
Code Organization:  Followed a modular approach by organizing code into components, screens, services, and utilities.
Navigation: Used a navigation library like React Navigation for handling navigation between screens.
Error Handling and Logging: Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully at the component level.

# New Technology?
Yes. Although I have previous experience in Javascript, this is my very first project where I created a mobile application using React-Native. With the number of apps increasing every year, the idea was to challenge myself and develop new skills for my future.

# Risk and challenges
Limited Knowledge: When I started the project, I was very new to the framework and limited to what I knew. One way I overcame that was to follow best practices and guidelines provided by React Native documentation. Videos and courses were quite helpful as well.
Issues with Expo:  Restricted access to certain native APIs and functionalities that are not included in the Expo SDK. I overcame this by researching tools and API that is compatible with the project. 
React Packages: Certain React dependencies were either unavailable or update to use for the restaurant application. Reading documentation and hearing from other peers was an alternative solution to installing the right packages. 

# Issues
As of now, there are no known issues in the application.
